Promotes Comfort\nMany diseases, brain and otherwise, are connected to chronic irritation and redness in the body. Plants like brahmi and turmeric have been studied extensively for their ability to fight discomfort and systemic redness. One review has identified brahmi as a potential therapy for chronic discomfort and neuropathy.\n\n2. Stress Reduction\nIf the effects of daily stressors are getting the best of you, brahmi supplementation may be something to explore. Stress reduction is perhaps brahmi\u2019s most well known, traditional use. A study evaluating brahmi supplementation reported significant mood improvement among participants, as well as decreased levels of cortisol, the stress hormone. This suggests that brahmi counteracts the effects of stress by regulating hormones involved with the stress response.\n\n3. Boosts Cognitive Agility\nA recent, placebo-controlled study of 24 volunteers reported that brahmi boosted cognitive performance. These results support use of the herb as a therapy by persons suffering from cognitive issues, short attention span, foggy memory, and blurred focus.\n\n4. Alzheimer\u2019s Therapy?\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease is a debilitating and heartbreaking disease, usually caused by a plethora of physiological, genetic, and environmental factors. Amyloid formation in neurons can cause significant brain damage and influence the development of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. It\u2019s important to understand that, to date, no herb, plant, drug, or anything \u2014 including brahmi \u2014 has been found to be the magic bullet against Alzheimer\u2019s. Based on its history as an herbal therapy to promote neurological function, some have suggested that brahmi may be a promising therapy for Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\n5. Protection Against Toxic Compounds\nNobody ever said French fries were healthy but do you realize just how toxic they can be? Enter acrylamide. Acrylamide is a toxic compound that forms when starches are heated above 248 degrees; in other words \u2014 fried. Acrylamide is a carcinogen that also damages brain tissue. In animal models, brahmi supplementation protected brain cells exposed to acrylamide from oxidative stress and neurotoxic effects.\n\n\nProduced by ISO 9001 : 2015 & HALAL Certified Company"

It is also used for malaria ,digestive stimulant, laxative, appetite suppressant, and diuretic.\n\nGymnema is considered safe for most people, but it should not be taken by children or women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or planning to get pregnant. Moreover, though it appears to improve blood sugar and insulin levels, it's not a substitute for diabetes medication\n\nGymnema may help you fight sugar cravings and lower high blood sugar levels. The plant may also play a beneficial role in diabetes treatment, as it may help stimulate insulin secretion and the regeneration of pancreas islet cells \u2014 both of which can help lower blood sugar\n\nHow To Take :\n\nGymnema sylvestre is traditionally consumed as a tea or by chewing its leaves. In Western medicine, it's typically taken in pill or tablet form, making it easier to control and monitor dosage. It can also be ingested in extract or leaf powder form\n\nTo make Gymnema sylvestre tea, you will need bagged or loose Gymnema leaves.\n\n- Add 1/4 cup leaves of Gymnema to a quart of boiling water\n- Steep 10 minutes\n- Drink 30 minutes or so before your meal or whenever you have a sweet tooth\n\nIf you take other Gymnema supplements, don\u2019t drink Gymnema tea, because you may accidentally take too much."

    description: "-Omega-3 essential fatty acids, \"good\" fats that have been shown to have heart-healthy effects. Each tablespoon of ground flaxseed contains about 1.8grams of plant omega-3s. Lignans, which have both plant estrogen and antioxidant qualities. Flaxseed contains 75 to 800 times more lignans than other plant foods.\n-Ground flaxseed is a good supporting player in a weight loss diet. It provides fiber, which helps you feel full and offers other weight-loss benefits. It's also one of the top sources of omega-3 fatty acids and lignan, which may facilitate your effort to drop excess pounds\n-These fatty acids are essential for healthy hair growth. They nourish the follicles and hairshafts, making them stronger and less prone to damage. This also ensures that the new growth is strong and healthy.\n\n\nBaking and Cooking with Flaxseeds:\n1. Add 1\u20133 tablespoons of ground flaxseed to a morning smoothie. ...\n2. Mix a tablespoon in with yogurt with some raw honey.\n3. Bake ground flaxseeds into muffins, cookies, and bread.\n4. Add to homemade sprouted granola.\n5. Mix with water and use as an egg substitute in vegetarian/vegan recipes.\n\nHow do you store flax seeds?\nWhether you purchase ground flaxseeds or grind them at home, it is important to keep them in a tightly sealed container in the refrigerator or\nfreezer to prevent them from becoming rancid. Ground flaxseeds stored in the refrigerator in this manner will keep fresh for six months; and in the freezer, for one year."
